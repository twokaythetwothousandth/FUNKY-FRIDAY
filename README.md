# FUNKY-FRIDAY
frugal autoplayer script.

this is an autoplayer script for the game "funky friday" in roblox.
game: https://www.roblox.com/games/6447798030/TAG-SALE-Funky-Friday?
i haven't bothered to refine the script, as this is only a prototype script. expect a load of messy code.

edit the local variable "selected" to either "Right" or "Left," according to the side you're going to pick.

there are probably better ones out here, but this is mines so far.
